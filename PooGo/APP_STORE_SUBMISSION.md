⚡ INSTANT RESULTS
One tap finds the nearest toilet. Or just shake your phone. That's it.

🚶 WALKING DIRECTIONS
Turn-by-turn directions appear immediately. Follow the route and find relief.

🆓 PRIORITIZES FREE OPTIONS
PooGo shows public toilets, train stations, parks, and shopping centres first - places where you don't need to buy anything.

🍔 BACKUP OPTIONS
If no free toilets are nearby, PooGo finds restaurants and cafes with restrooms.

📍 WORKS EVERYWHERE
Public toilets, train stations, parks, supermarkets, shopping centres, libraries, hospitals, and fast food restaurants.

PERFECT FOR:
• Travelers exploring new cities
• Parents with young children
• People with IBS, Crohn's, or other conditions
• Delivery drivers and couriers
• Anyone caught short

WHY POOGO?
Google Maps takes 6-8 taps to find a toilet. PooGo takes ONE.
When nature calls, every second counts.
