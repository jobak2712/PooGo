## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does PooGo need my location?
PooGo uses your location to find toilets near you. Without location access, the app cannot function. Your location is only used when you actively search for a toilet.

### The app can't find my location
- Make sure Location Services are enabled in Settings > Privacy > Location Services
- Ensure PooGo has permission to access your location
- Try moving to an area with better GPS signal (outdoors works best)

### No toilets found near me
- PooGo searches within 15km of your location
- Try shaking again - sometimes the search needs a retry
- In very remote areas, there may not be any registered public toilets nearby

### How do I report a wrong toilet location?
Tap the thumbs down button after visiting a toilet and select "Not a Toilet" to report incorrect locations. This helps improve results for everyone.
